Project prepared as part of learning backend technologies. I designed the visual page in Figma with the support of the Shadcn-ui component library.

Ready4Tech focuses on learning through repetition using flashcards with questions and answers. Users can choose from various question categories. Initially, only the question is displayed, prompting users to recall the answer from memory. After clicking a button, the answer is revealed, and users can decide whether to move on to the next question or keep it for further review. Each learning session is saved, allowing users to continue from where they left off.
